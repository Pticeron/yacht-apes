What Is Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)?

Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) is a collection of 10,000 NFT Apes, each with completely unique traits. Some traits are rarer than others meaning that collectors place more value on them. By purchasing an Ape, you also get exclusive access to future collections and other perks as a member of BAYC.

BAYC holders were able to turn their Apes into Mutant Apes with a serum distributed via airdrop. The mutants were also minted in a public sale available for 3 ETH each. Holders of original BAYC Apes also got the chance to mint a Club Dog NFT for free. The club donated a royalty fee on secondary sales to animal charities.

Part of BAYC's success has been its focus on creating a universe and exclusive club behind the NFTs. With games like the Mutant Arcade, charitable acts, and club benefits, BAYC has maintained the hype and a relatively high floor price.
